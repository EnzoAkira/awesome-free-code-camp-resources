## General

1. **Start a blog detailing your journey** of learning to code. Since I have started this blog I have received numerous email of encouragement, requests for help, and recommendation to help me continue to learn. It has also helped me to land interviews and connect with people from all over the world.
1. **Attend Meetups** - I think it is great to start going to meet-ups as soon as possible. You can go to technology-specific ones like NodeJS or ReactJS or some more beginner-friendly ones like Girl Develop It and Free Code Camp Meetups. You will probably feel out of place at first and sometimes you might not understand what is going on in the presentation. It might take some time
1. **Create Anki Decks for each topic** (e.g. HTML, JS-functions, JS-terms, etc.) and keep adding to them. Here are some starter decks I have uploaded for JS and Sass (I am still working on sorting out all my enormous, disorganized decks of cards so I will keep adding and uploading more). Every time I hear a new term on a podcast or meet-up or blog or anywhere else I write it down in an Evernote file and then add it to my decks when I get home.
1. **Start following industry thought leaders.** Some of my favorites are: Quincy Larson, Scott Moss(Angular/Node), Henrik Joretag, Kyle Simpson, and Dan Abrimov(React/Redux)
1. **Get involved in your local FCC meetups or other coding meetups.** This could be by helping to organize or volunteering as a speaker, etc. Try to become someone everyone recognizes in the local coding community.

## HTML

* [MarkSheet](http://marksheet.io/) - Teaches basic html and css for free
* [Don't fear the internet](http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/) - Lot's of great tutorials to simplify learning html and css

## CSS

#### *some topics in html section also relevant

1. [Introductory CSS Topics Playlist on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL478wQWRhpfayR-iXIUvAhcwVXKHlpFHX) - Kirupa Chinnathambi
1. [CSS Sushi](https://flukeout.github.io/) - Very well designed game for learning CSS
1. [Team Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) - Excellent video courses for learning CSS and Responsive Web Design

## Sass

* [Great Sass video crash course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLriKzYyLb28nvORWgaD0hAbBcJUcsxy16) - Youtube
* [Overview of Sass Indented Syntax](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.INDENTED_SYNTAX.html)
* [The Sass Way](http://marksheet.io/sass-scss-less.html) - compares Sass, SCSS, and Less

## jQuery

* [Try jQuery Free on Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-jquery)

#### Comparing jQuery with standard Javascript:

* [Stop Writing Slow Javascript](http://ilikekillnerds.com/2015/02/stop-writing-slow-javascript/) - Article
* [might not need jquery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) - Good for learning what goes on under the hood in jQuery and understanding if you need to use in your project it or not.

## Javascript - Beginner

1. [Introduction to Javascript Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL478wQWRhpfa1aPYzB_CzhJ-vFQ7BCeZS) on Youtube - by Kirupa Chinnathambi
1. [Code Combat](https://codecombat.com/play/dungeon) - Game for learning javascript programming

## Javascript - Advanced

1. Learn good programming techniques and fundamentals. Here is a video series by learncode.Academy on Modular Programming.
1. Understand how scope works in JavaScript. Read the MDN documentation on lexical scoping here and try the examples in Codepen or JSFiddle. Here is an article on lexical scoping that's also pretty good and easy to understand.
1. Know the different ways to create objects and how prototypes work. I recommend this YouTube Video to understand the basics and then watching this series on Front End Master's to understand more about objects.
1. Understand the 'this' keyword. Read this article.
1. Learn Functional Programming. Immutability, closures, pure vs impure functions, lists, etc. - these are extremely important concepts to understand as a programmer! I highly recommend Front End Master's course on Functional Programming Lite. Once you work through that course, they also have several more advanced courses on Advanced Functional Programming, Asynchronous Javascript, and Coercion that are all quite good as well. The subscription is $39/month and worth every penny.
1. ES6/ES2015. It's important to learn all the updates that are currently being implemented in JS. Here is a good podcast about the history of Javascript leading up to ES6 by Brendan Eich (the creator of JS) to give you a good understanding about the languages history and future. Also, here is a two-video series that gives a good overview of the new features in ES2015 and another awesome video covering generators.

## Javascript - Algorithms

1. Khan academy has a good [introduction to solving different types of algorithms](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms)
1. [hackerrank.com lets you solve algorithms in multiple languages, from beginner to advanced](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

## React

* [React/Flux](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGABj2GQSlDRjgvXtqfDxKm5b) and [React/Redux](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGADILc3iUJzygCqC8Tt3bRXt) YouTube courses - both by learncode.Academy
* Another Great Youtube Series
* [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) - by Stephen Grider
* [Facebook Developers have several React Playlists](https://www.youtube.com/user/FacebookDevelopers/playlists) - Youtube
* I think it's best to start by reading the very good React documentation and copy/pasting the example code to try out for yourself in codepen (just make sure you are using the babel preprocessor or it won't work). The docs also explain how to use the 'marked' library which is necessary for the first FCC React project. Make sure you read the section about 'thinking in react' and then go and watch the Facebook team's videos, even if you don't understand them right away.

This video series is by far the best react/redux tutorial I have found anywhere. It is about five hours total but it is time well spent and will teach you about the how and why of React/Redux as well as how to set up projects with Webpack and hot module reloading. You might have to stop and look at the docs and google a bit, but once I was done, I was able to set up my own react project pretty well.
To get used to working with Redux, their github page has a great examples folder you can clone and play around with on your local machine (Dan Abrimov actually pointed me in this direction while I was getting very frustrated with some of the concepts).
Once you understand the basics, I would watch the Egghead.io Redux series by Dan Abrimov. It goes pretty fast, but it gives you a good, deeper understanding of how Redux works. You can complete the first few FCC React Projects without Redux but you pretty much need it for the more complicated projects.

## Redux

* [Lot's of React/Redux Links](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links178)
* [Redux Examples on Github](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples50)
* [Free series on Redux](https://learnredux.com/?utm_source=sendy&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=reduxlaunch)

## D3

If you can work through this tutorial and some of the official docs, I think you will be all set to complete the challenges in Free Code Camp for d3.

## Node/Express

* [The New Boston Node Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBMdkKFn3HasZnnAqVjzHn_) - Youtube
* [Intro to Node Playlist by learncode.Academy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGAACzU6GliHJDp4kmOw3NFsh) - Youtube
* [Intro to Node Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-node-js-developer-course) - Udemy, Paid

## MongoDB

* [MongoDB University](https://university.mongodb.com/) - Lot's of free follow-along courses

## Audiobooks

1. [No Degree, No Problem](https://www.amazon.com/No-Degree-Problem/dp/B00KLF48QG) by Josh Kemp
  - This is a very motivating audio book if you are teaching yourself how to code. The author talks about his journey where he landed a developer job in ~9 months of teaching himself and shares some important experiences. The book talks mostly about Ruby on Rails but is also very useful for people learning JS or any other language. I prefer the audiobook but it is also available for Kindle.
1. [Soft Skills](https://www.amazon.com/Soft-Skills-Software-Developers-Manual/dp/B0158SJ3EM) by John Sonmez
  
## Books/eBooks

1. [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X), by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. This book tops most bloggers lists of 'must reads' for programmers and for good reason: it's packed with useful information that can take your coding to the next level. Unfortunately it's not available in audiobook format but can be purchased in paperback or for Kindle.
1. [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882), by Robert Martin

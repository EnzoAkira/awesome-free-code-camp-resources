## General

1. **Start a blog detailing your journey** of learning to code. Since I have started this blog I have received numerous email of encouragement, requests for help, and recommendation to help me continue to learn. It has also helped me to land interviews and connect with people from all over the world.
1. **Attend Meetups** - I think it is great to start going to meet-ups as soon as possible. You can go to technology-specific ones like NodeJS or ReactJS or some more beginner-friendly ones like Girl Develop It and Free Code Camp Meetups. You will probably feel out of place at first and sometimes you might not understand what is going on in the presentation. It might take some time
1. **Create Anki Decks for each topic** (e.g. HTML, JS-functions, JS-terms, etc.) and keep adding to them. Here are some starter decks I have uploaded for JS and Sass (I am still working on sorting out all my enormous, disorganized decks of cards so I will keep adding and uploading more). Every time I hear a new term on a podcast or meet-up or blog or anywhere else I write it down in an Evernote file and then add it to my decks when I get home.
1. **Start following industry thought leaders.** Some of my favorites are: Quincy Larson, Scott Moss(Angular/Node), Henrik Joretag, Kyle Simpson, and Dan Abrimov(React/Redux)
1. **Get involved in your local FCC meetups or other coding meetups.** This could be by helping to organize or volunteering as a speaker, etc. Try to become someone everyone recognizes in the local coding community.

Unfortunately it's not available in audiobook format but can be purchased in paperback or for Kindle.

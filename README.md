### Here are some of the best resources or pieces of advice that have helped me at various stages in my learning which work very well with Free Code Camp's learning path:

The first and most important piece of advice I can give you is to not stress yourself out or compare yourself to others. Make a plan and work through each step one at a time. The beauty of Free Code Camp is that you can see your progress by accruing points and completing projects. There will always be people who are faster or seemingly smarter than you and can make you feel inferior. Just this morning, someone I look at as an awesome programmer who seems 100x smarter than me told me that he feels the same way when he meets other programmers. It's a completely normal feeling! If you are doubting your ability to be successful, I strongly recommend you listen to the first audio book on the list, "No Degree, No Problem".

## General

1. Start a blog detailing your journey of learning to code. Since I have started this blog I have received numerous email of encouragement, requests for help, and recommendation to help me continue to learn. It has also helped me to land interviews and connect with people from all over the world.
1. Attend Meetups - I think it is great to start going to meet-ups as soon as possible. You can go to technology-specific ones like NodeJS or ReactJS or some more beginner-friendly ones like Girl Develop It and Free Code Camp Meetups. You will probably feel out of place at first and sometimes you might not understand what is going on in the presentation. It might take some time
1. Create Anki Decks for each topic (e.g. HTML, JS-functions, JS-terms, etc.) and keep adding to them. Here are some starter decks I have uploaded for JS and Sass (I am still working on sorting out all my enormous, disorganized decks of cards so I will keep adding and uploading more). Every time I hear a new term on a podcast or meet-up or blog or anywhere else I write it down in an Evernote file and then add it to my decks when I get home.

## Audiobooks

1. Audiobook - No Degree, No Problem by Josh Kemp
  - This is a very motivating audio book if you are teaching yourself how to code. The author talks about his journey where he landed a developer job in ~9 months of teaching himself and shares some important experiences. The book talks mostly about Ruby on Rails but is also very useful for people learning JS or any other language. I prefer the audiobook but it is also available for Kindle.
  
## Books/eBooks
  
## Podcasts

1. Podcasts - Code Newbie (as the name implies, very noob-friendly) and Javascript Jabber (this one generally covers a little more in depth topics that you might not understand right away) are both excellent. You can scroll through the history and find the ones that interest you like I did or start from the beginning. Podcasts are amazing resources to help you learn about and keep up with current technologies as well as develop a broader understanding of the developer field.

## Other








## Once you start working through the algorithm challenges:

1. Learn good programming techniques and fundamentals. Here is a video series by learncode.Academy on Modular Programming.
1. Understand how scope works in JavaScript. Read the MDN documentation on lexical scoping here and try the examples in Codepen or JSFiddle. Here is an article on lexical scoping that's also pretty good and easy to understand.
1. Know the different ways to create objects and how prototypes work. I recommend this YouTube Video to understand the basics and then watching this series on Front End Master's to understand more about objects.
1. Understand the 'this' keyword. Read this article.
1. Learn Functional Programming. Immutability, closures, pure vs impure functions, lists, etc. - these are extremely important concepts to understand as a programmer! I highly recommend Front End Master's course on Functional Programming Lite. Once you work through that course, they also have several more advanced courses on Advanced Functional Programming, Asynchronous Javascript, and Coercion that are all quite good as well. The subscription is $39/month and worth every penny.
1. ES6/ES2015. It's important to learn all the updates that are currently being implemented in JS. Here is a good podcast about the history of Javascript leading up to ES6 by Brendan Eich (the creator of JS) to give you a good understanding about the languages history and future. Also, here is a two-video series that gives a good overview of the new features in ES2015 and another awesome video covering generators.
1. It's also important to learn git and the command line. Here is a good resource that takes you step by step through learning git and also check out Learn the Command Line the Hard Way by David Shaw.
1. Read this book - The Pragmatic Programmer, by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. This book tops most bloggers lists of 'must reads' for programmers and for good reason: it's packed with useful information that can take your coding to the next level. Unfortunately it's not available in audiobook format but can be purchased in paperback or for Kindle.
1. Algorithm practice - every single company I have interviewed with (except for one) has asked me to solve various problems in JS or 'my preferred language'. Khan academy has a good introduction to solving different types of algorithms here. I have finished all the problems on Free Code Camp - some of them twice - and I now set aside time, about 30 minutes two or three times per week, to solve challenges on hackerrank.com. This has really helped my programming confidence and also given me a better understanding of coding in general since I now try to work through problems in Javascript as well as in Python or Clojure.
1. Start following industry thought leaders. Some of my favorites are: Quincy Larson, Scott Moss(Angular/Node), Henrik Joretag, Kyle Simpson, and Dan Abrimov(React/Redux)
1. Get involved in your local FCC meetups or any other meetups. This could be by helping to organize or volunteering as a speaker, etc. Try to become someone everyone recognizes in the local coding community.

Sass, React/Redux, and D3.JS:

React/Redux

I think it's best to start by reading the very good React documentation and copy/pasting the example code to try out for yourself in codepen (just make sure you are using the babel preprocessor or it won't work). The docs also explain how to use the 'marked' library which is necessary for the first FCC React project. Make sure you read the section about 'thinking in react' and then go and watch the Facebook team's videos, even if you don't understand them right away.
This is a great list of what you should learn next and in what order.
This video series is by far the best react/redux tutorial I have found anywhere. It is about five hours total but it is time well spent and will teach you about the how and why of React/Redux as well as how to set up projects with Webpack and hot module reloading. You might have to stop and look at the docs and google a bit, but once I was done, I was able to set up my own react project pretty well.
To get used to working with Redux, their github page has a great examples folder you can clone and play around with on your local machine (Dan Abrimov actually pointed me in this direction while I was getting very frustrated with some of the concepts).
Once you understand the basics, I would watch the Egghead.io Redux series by Dan Abrimov. It goes pretty fast, but it gives you a good, deeper understanding of how Redux works. You can complete the first few FCC React Projects without Redux but you pretty much need it for the more complicated projects.
Sass Resources

Almost every sass tutorial shows you the .scss syntax (which is now the default) with curly braces and semi-colons. I personally like cleaner, indented syntax with no semi-colons but it is hard to find up-to-date tutorials for it. I recommend learning .scss first here with this good crash course and then learning the indented .sass syntax by reading this.

d3.js Tutorials

If you can work through this tutorial and some of the official docs, I think you will be all set to complete the challenges in Free Code Camp for d3.




I really believe that anyone who puts in the effort and stays positive will most definitely succeed in endeavor of learning to code.
